# shelving is at the destination. Arrival for the OPL = the earliest such
# `shelved_on`. Buckets are reused across orders, so we also require the
# shelving to have happened at/after the OPL was created (>= o2.creation) —
# otherwise a stale Kapkolia entry from a PREVIOUS cycle would falsely mark an
# order as arrived (and yield a negative transit time). bucket_id case is
# inconsistent between tables → compare UPPER().
