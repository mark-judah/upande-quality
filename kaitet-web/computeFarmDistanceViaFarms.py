# through, derived from the road-leg graph (is_road_leg=1 records) — never hardcoded
# to specific farm names. If more farms/roads are added to Farm Distance later, this
# recomputes correctly with zero code changes, because it re-reads the graph fresh
# every save. A direct road (is_road_leg=1) passes through nothing -> blank.
# safe_exec: no imports/def — plain lists/dicts/while loops, index-based queue
# (avoid list.pop(), stick to the .append() pattern already proven to work here).
