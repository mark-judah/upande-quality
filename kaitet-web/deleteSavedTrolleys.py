# Frappe Server Script (Type: API), api_method = deleteSavedTrolleys
# Undo a SAVED trolley grouping WITHOUT re-shelving its buckets.
# Clears custom_trolley_id / custom_loaded_in_trolley / custom_awaiting_transfer
# on the trolley's Pick List Item rows, leaving custom_shelf untouched.
# Only acts on not-yet-loaded rows (custom_in_transit != 1); loaded ones are
# skipped and reported back.
#
# Matching is Pick List Item-FIRST (by custom_trolley_id), because saved
# trolleys live on OPLs of EITHER docstatus (draft AND submitted) — an earlier
# version scoped to draft OPLs only and matched 0 rows for submitted-OPL
# trolleys. Farm is used only as a cross-farm safety check via the parent OPL.
#
# Payload (form params): trolley_ids = "T1|~|T2", farm = "Karen", dry_run = "1" (optional)
# safe_exec: no def/import/+=/.append/parse_json/sql.
